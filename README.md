### Current games that need testing

Please see the [patches folder](https://github.com/ArcadeTV/msuplus-tracker/tree/main/patches) for beta patches.

---

### soundPacks

All soundPacks are maintained by Relikk. [This folder](https://mega.nz/folder/5MlkSBqR#ZzodSLacnwV3d9I6mGiYLw) contains soundPacks for current patches in development.

If you need test-tracks for soundPack-creation, you will find numbered text-to-speech wave files in the `audio` folder.

### What to test

* [x] General playback: is the audio playing, stopping or fading correctly?
* [x] Pause function, may not be implemented yet in beta versions. Playback pausing/resuming should be identical to the original game's behaviour.
* [x] Different platforms: MegaSD, Mega Everdrive Pro, RetroArch /w Genesis-Plus-GX core, MiSTer (MD+ not yet compatible)
* [x] Resetting/Restarting
* [x] A complete playthrough would be A+, you could use cheat codes to speed up the process.

### When do tests end?

I will green-light a patch when at least 2 users claim, that the game was extensively tested without any issues.

The patch will be added to the zeldix database.

### Sneek Peeks

I'll drop recordings of current work-in-progress patches in my gDrive folder here:

### Requesting new patches

Please note that my knowledge about all this is limited. As of today I can create patches for games that use the following sound drivers:
* SMPS
* GEMS
* Krisalis
* Cube
* TecnoSoft

I can try to interface any other games but it's not guaranteed to work. Please see [this list](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Mega_Drive/Genesis_Sound_Driver_List) to identify the driver being used prior to asking for new patches.

The Electronic Arts sound drivers are above my head. Audios Wave Slave MD is also giving me a hard time since 2021.
