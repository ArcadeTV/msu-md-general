### What to test

* [x] General playback: is the audio playing, stopping or fading correctly?
* [x] Pause function, may not be implemented yet in beta versions. Playback pausing/resuming should be identical to the original game's behaviour.
* [x] Different platforms: MegaSD, Mega Everdrive Pro, RetroArch /w Genesis-Plus-GX core, MiSTer (MD+ not yet compatible)
* [x] Resetting/Restarting
* [x] A complete playthrough would be A+, you could use cheat codes to speed up the process.
