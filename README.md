* [ ] Joe & Mac (MD+)
* [ ] Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (MD+) [soundPack needed]

### What to test

* [x] General playback: is the audio playing, stopping or fading correctly?
* [x] Pause function, may not be implemented yet in beta versions. Playback pausing/resuming should be identical to the original game's behaviour.
* [x] Different platforms: MegaSD, Mega Everdrive Pro, RetroArch /w Genesis-Plus-GX core, MiSTer (MD+ not yet compatible)
* [x] Resetting/Restarting
* [x] A complete playthrough would be A+, you could use cheat codes to speed up the process.

### When do tests end?

I will green-light a patch when at least 2 users claim, that the game was extensively tested without any issues.

### Requesting new patches

Please note that my knowledge about all this is limited. As of today I can create patches for games that use the following sound drivers:
* SMPS
* GEMS
* Krisalis
* Cube
* TecnoSoft

I can try to interface any other games but it's not guaranteed to work. Please see [this list](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Mega_Drive/Genesis_Sound_Driver_List) to identify the driver being used prior to asking for new patches.

The Electronic Arts sound drivers are above my head. Audios Wave Slave MD is also giving me a hard time since 2021.
